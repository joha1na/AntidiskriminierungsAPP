You can seek advice from a member of the Anti-Discrimination Council, a Women's and Equal Opportunities Officer or a member of the Confidentiality Team. These people offer confidential initial and referral counselling, provide information on support options, reporting and complaints procedures and, if necessary, can seek conflict resolution and document reports and complaints in accordance with data protection regulations.<br><br>The list of possible contact persons can be found <a class=\"link-inside-translation\" href=\"/getincontact\">here</a>.<br><br>Students can contact the general student counselling service, the psychological counselling service, the women's and equal opportunities officers, the representative for disabled and chronically ill students and the student representatives - in particular the anti-discrimination department of the AStA. <br><br>The Staff Council, the Women's and Equal Opportunities Officers and the representative of severely disabled employees are responsible for the other member groups.",
    "faq.q2": "What can I do if I need urgent help at the weekend?",
    "faq.a2": "Please use the support services for people in crisis in Berlin or nationwide. <a class=\"link-inside-translation\" href=\"https://www.htw-berlin.de/einrichtungen/zentrale-referate/frauenfoerderung-gleichstellung/sexualisierte-diskriminierung-gewalt/#c10576\">Here</a> you will find further contact information.",
    "faq.q3": "Who can I contact as a victim or witness to report an incident or submit a complaint?",
    "faq.a3": "You can use the <a class=\"link-inside-translation\" href=\"/kontaktformular\">online form</a> for this purpose. Reports can be made anonymously or by name.<br><br>Your report will be sent directly to Prof Dr Annabella Rauscher-Scheibe, President of HTW Berlin, and will be treated confidentially.<br><br>Before submitting a report, you should <a class=\"link-inside-translation\" href=\"/getincontact\">seek advice</a> , e.g. on the difference between a report and a complaint, on the advantages of reporting by name and on how to deal with your report.",
    "faq.q4": "What happens after a report or complaint?",
    "faq.a4": "The university management has appointed members of the university to a so-called <a class=\"link-inside-translation\" href=\"/getincontact\">confidentiality team</a>. The team of confidants is diverse and has knowledge of the relevant legal principles, prevention and victim protection as well as dialogue and mediation.<br><br>Reports and complaints are dealt with jointly by three members of the confidential team. They discuss the reported incidents and advise on the next steps. In doing so, they involve the person concerned - unless the report was made anonymously. If necessary, they will advise the person concerned about external counselling and support options. <br><br>The members of the confidential counselling team undergo regular training and supervision.",
    "faq.q5": "What does the university do to protect those affected and witnesses who submit a report or complaint?",
    "faq.a5": "The confidentiality team carries out a risk assessment for every report or complaint. It guarantees strict confidentiality. It always treats information according to the \"need-to-know principle\" in order to minimise the number of people in the know.",
    "faq.q6": "What are the consequences of misconduct by members of the university?",
    "faq.a6": "This depends on the severity of the incident in question; a generalised answer is not possible. One consequence may be an awareness-raising or confrontation meeting with the reported person to make them aware of their misconduct and prevent repetition. A requirement to take part in training, e.g. anti-discrimination training, may also be imposed. The university's sanction options include, for example, a temporary ban from the premises as well as consequences under personnel law such as a warning (for employees).",
    "faq.q7": "What are the principles of anti-discrimination work at HTW Berlin?",
    "faq.a7": "HTW Berlin promotes a safe, non-discriminatory and non-violent place to learn and work, characterised by acceptance, trust and respect. It values the diversity of its members and supports their individual strengths. HTW Berlin combats discriminatory behaviour, protects the rights of those affected and holds perpetrators accountable.<br><br>It is important to choose the relevant terms carefully in order to gain the trust of those affected and ensure their appropriate support. Persons affected are labelled in this way so as not to reduce their person to the experience of discrimination alone. A reported person is referred to as a 'person under suspicion' and not as a 'perpetrator'.",
    "faq.q8": "What are the three pillars of HTW Berlin's anti-discrimination work?",
    "faq.a8": "The three pillars are prevention, advice and complaint and reporting procedures. Preventive measures aim to raise awareness, train and identify dangerous areas and situations. Counseling services are available to those affected and others seeking advice. Complaint and reporting procedures enable those affected to defend themselves against discrimination and violence.",
    "faq.q9": "What are the tasks of the HTW Berlin Anti-Discrimination Council?",
    "faq.a9": "The <a class=\"link-inside-translation\" href=\"/getincontact\">Anti-Discrimination Council</a> is responsible for implementing anti-discrimination work at HTW Berlin. He creates an action plan, networks the consulting infrastructure and advises the university committees and managers. The Anti-Discrimination Council is made up of representatives from all member groups who carry out advisory tasks in their activities or offices.",
    "faq.q10": "What does ‘affected partiality’ mean?",
    "faq.a10": "HTW Berlin focuses on the needs and perspectives of those affected in order to offer them protection and support. If necessary, she refers those affected to external psychosocial and legal advice centers. These institutions support those affected, taking their own decisions into account. Since university members may be overwhelmed and have other responsibilities, HTW Berlin relies on the advisory infrastructure of the state of Berlin and the federal government.",
    "faq.q11": "What does ‘fairness for those affected’ mean?",
    "faq.a11": "Fairness for those affected means putting the perspectives and needs of those affected in the foreground, without the claim to objective clarification of the incident. HTW Berlin takes reports and complaints seriously, investigates them and takes action if necessary. The focus is on protecting those affected and the university takes a clear position against violations of the HTW anti-discrimination guidelines. The decisions are based on the principle “When in doubt, for those affected” and encourage reporting. HTW Berlin works closely with external advice centers to offer support to those affected and to take their interests into account.",
